# Temo-Letlotlo 🌾

## About Me 😊

Hi there! I'm a passionate software developer working on the National Arable Farming Programme in Botswana, [Temo-Letlotlo](https://temoletlotlo.com/), since October 2022. As a backend developer, I've been using TypeScript and Node.js to create a robust web API. Over this time, I've grown immensely in my understanding of RESTful web APIs and related technologies.

### A Bit More About My Journey 🚀

- 🎓 **BSc in Information Systems and Data Management**: Recently completed my degree while simultaneously working on Temo-Letlotlo. Balancing both commitments taught me time management and multitasking skills.
- 💼 **Internship at Botswana Harvard Health Partnership**: After completing my degree, I took on an internship where I had my first experience with Django and worked with legacy code, contributing to a large public repository. This was all while continuing my work at Temo-Letlotlo, demonstrating my ability to juggle multiple responsibilities effectively.
- 🏆 **UNESCO India-Africa Hackathon**: In November 2022, I participated in the UNESCO India Africa Hackathon held at Gautam Buddha University in Greater Noida. Our team secured the 1st position, which was a thrilling and rewarding experience.
- 🔥 **Passion Projects**: Currently working on an exciting project called [Fate Phantasm, BW Ghost's Touch](https://github.com/Onkgopotse007/Fate-Phantasm-BW-Ghost-touch). This is a game I'm developing using .NET WebAPI for the backend, inspired by the Fate series characters by Kinoko Nasu. I really enjoyed watching the anime and thought of creating an RPG based on those characters. Feel free to check it out and explore the code!

### Achievements and Contributions 🌟

During my time on the Temo-Letlotlo project, I've made significant contributions:

- 📈 **Grant Distribution Module**: Created a comprehensive module that efficiently distributes grants to farmers. This module also generates vouchers which farmers can use to redeem seeds and ploughing services.
- 💸 **Impact**: In the 2023/24 ploughing season, this module distributed in excess of BWP 350 million, significantly supporting the farming community.

### Skills and Technologies 🛠️

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: Node.js, Django
- **Databases**: SQL, NoSQL
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Postman, Azure devops
